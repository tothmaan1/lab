GitLab Practice Notes
Yesterday, we executed the following steps:

Created an account on gitlab.com.
Created a repository named "lab" on GitLab.
On our personal laptop, we created an SSH public/private key pair:
a) To generate the keys, run:
bash ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" Follow the prompts, and take all defaults for file location and passphrase (if you desire a passphrase).

b) Display the public key and copy it:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Copy the output.
Uploaded the public SSH key to GitLab:
Go to GitLab, then navigate to Settings > SSH Keys.
Paste your public key into the provided field and save it.

Cloned the repository that we created on GitLab:

Use the SSH method to clone your repository (ensure you have the correct URL from GitLab):

git clone git@gitlab.com:<username>/lab.git
Replace <username> with your GitLab username.

Additional Notes:
Make sure you use the SSH URL from GitLab when cloning if you set up SSH keys, as this allows you to operate without entering your credentials frequently.

remember to configure your Git client with your name and email:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
These configurations help identify the author of the commits and are necessary for collaborative projects.
This should correct and clarify your practice notes. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to add or further details you need!
